  <description>This mod uses xpath patching to tweak cost lists and textures for vanilla workbenches (and a couple of extras) in order to make them buildable from various materials.
For those that already had partial "stuff" support I left the vanilla textures and only added the missing stuff types.
I cobbled together shaded white textures for the rest. Sadly the brewery was much too busy to get a decent base texture out of it, so I ended up making a completely new texture for it. (Disclaimer: I'm not that good at artsy things.)


Added new building materials:
Sculpting Table
Butcher Table

Stonecutter Table

Hi-Tech Research Bench (Simple Research Bench is unchanged, but pictured because of brain derp)
